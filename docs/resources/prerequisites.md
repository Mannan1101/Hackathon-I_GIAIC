# Prerequisites Self-Assessment

Before starting this course, you should have the following knowledge and skills.

## Required Prerequisites

### 1. Programming

**Python (Primary Language)**
- [ ] Variables, data types, and control flow
- [ ] Functions and classes
- [ ] Lists, dictionaries, and sets
- [ ] File I/O operations
- [ ] Basic debugging skills

**Assessment**: Can you write a Python program that reads a CSV file, processes the data, and outputs results?

### 2. Mathematics

**Linear Algebra**
- [ ] Vectors and vector operations
- [ ] Matrices and matrix multiplication
- [ ] Dot product and cross product
- [ ] Transformations and coordinate systems

**Calculus**
- [ ] Derivatives and partial derivatives
- [ ] Basic optimization concepts
- [ ] Understanding of gradients

**Probability and Statistics**
- [ ] Probability distributions
- [ ] Mean, variance, standard deviation
- [ ] Basic statistical inference

**Assessment**: Can you multiply two 3×3 matrices by hand? Do you understand what a derivative represents?

### 3. Computer Science Fundamentals

- [ ] Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees)
- [ ] Algorithm complexity (Big O notation)
- [ ] Object-oriented programming concepts
- [ ] Version control with Git

**Assessment**: Can you implement a basic data structure like a queue or stack?

## Recommended Prerequisites

These are helpful but not strictly required:

### 4. Physics

- [ ] Basic mechanics (force, velocity, acceleration)
- [ ] Kinematics (motion in 2D and 3D)
- [ ] Newton's laws of motion

### 5. Machine Learning

- [ ] Neural network basics
- [ ] Training and validation concepts
- [ ] Supervised vs. unsupervised learning

### 6. C++

- [ ] Basic syntax and compilation
- [ ] Pointers and references
- [ ] Classes and inheritance

### 7. Control Theory

- [ ] Feedback loops
- [ ] PID controllers
- [ ] System stability

## Self-Assessment Quiz

Answer these questions to gauge your readiness:

1. **Python**: Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the mean and standard deviation.

2. **Linear Algebra**: Given a rotation matrix, can you describe what transformation it represents?

3. **Calculus**: What is the derivative of f(x) = x² + 2x + 1?

4. **Probability**: If you roll two dice, what is the probability of getting a sum of 7?

5. **Data Structures**: Explain the difference between a stack and a queue.
